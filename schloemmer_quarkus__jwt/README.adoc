== Why JWT?

* JWT = Json Web Token

JWT are used to securely transmit information between parties. This information contains mainly
claims between different parties.

An example when carrying a claim:
"Hello Sever B, Server A told me that I could <claim goes here>, and here's the proof (the JWT)"

=== Why JWT should not be used to store Sessions

1. The tokens cannot be invalidated. If, for example, a user changes their password and the auth-session
is stored in the token, then someone with the token (which should be invalid) can still access
sensitive data

2. Data stored in tokens can go stale. If, for example, a user loses their admin right, but still
have a valid token claiming that they're admins, one would have to shut down the server to prevent
them from attacking

3. JWT can in theory be stolen

=== What are claims?

A claim is a right to something. JWTs contain claims. These claims can be things like the
issuer of the token, or its expiration date. ("The token claims to be issued by the server...")

=== The JWT structure

JWT consist of 3 parts, that are separated by a dot (".")

* Header
* Payload
* Signature

==== The Header

The header contains two parts. The type, and the signature algorithm.

==== The Payload

The payload contains the claims. Common claims are:

* *iss* (issuer): identifies the principal which issued the claim (_a principle can be a person, a service, a server or a client_)
* *sub* (subject): The user the token is for, should be a user ID
* *exp* (expiration time): The time until the token is valid

==== The Signature

The signature is what makes JWTs special. With the signature the legitimacy of a token can be
verified. The receiver can ensure that the token wasn't modified. *The signature contains both the payload and the subject*

=== The Signing Process

The signing happens in multiple steps.

1. The signature is created from the header and the payload. Signature = Header + Payload
2. The signature is hashed. [hash(signature)]
3. The hash is then encrypted with the private key

Basically: encrypt(hash(signature), privateKey) = encrypted_signature

How can the anyone verify that the token hasn't been modified by the bearer? When you decrypt
the encrypted signature with the public key, you receive the original hash of the key.
When the receiver of the key then hashes the received signature and payload, the decrypted hash
can be compared to the just calculated hash. If the hash is equal, the key hasn't been modified.

decrypt(encrypt(hash(signature), privateKey), publicKey) = hash(header + payload)

==== Why this works

The corresponding public key can decrypt messages encrypted from *only* the original private key.
If someone were to change the token (add claims, change claims, etc) and encrypt the hashed signature
with a different private key, the decryption with the _real_ public key would not return the same hash
anymore.

== Explaining Private / Public Keys

Private- / Public-Key encryption is asymmetrical encryption. Generating the keys is done with certain
algorithms.

* RSA
* DSA

=== RSA

RSA includes signing and encrypting for the contained message. It is good when encryption is
needed a lot.

=== DSA

DSA only signs and encrypts the signature, but not the contained message. DSA is good for fast key
generation.

=== JWT in Java

* All available libraries at: https://jwt.io/
* Library of choice: https://bitbucket.org/b_c/jose4j/wiki/Home

== Generating a JWT in Java

=== Generating claims

[source,java]
----
JwtClaims claims = new JwtClaims();
claims.setIssuer("https://this-is-our.domain")
claims.set...
----

=== Reading the Private Key

[source,java]
----
import static io.smallrye.jwt.KeyUtils.readPrivateKey;
...
PrivateKey pk = readPrivateKey("/private.pem");
----

Generating the token works in 5 basic steps.

1. Set the Payload (the claims)
2. Set the key (SSL Private Keys)
3. Set the header (type is JWT)
4. Set the signing algorithm header
5. serialise the key

[source,java]
----
JwtClaims claims = getJwtClaims(uid);

JsonWebSignature jws = new JsonWebSignature();
jws.setPayload(claims.toJson()); // 1.
jws.setKey(privateKey); // 2.
jws.setHeader("typ", "JWT"); // 3.
jws.setAlgorithmHeaderValue(AlgorithmIdentifiers.RSA_USING_SHA256); // 4.

return jws.getCompactSerialization(); // 5.
----

== Quarkus - Securing Resources

=== Generating SSL keys to encrypt the token

In the folder src/main/resources execute following commands:

[source]
----
% openssl genpkey -out private.pem -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
% openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
----

This generates RSA keys using SHA-256 cryptography. Note, the private key has to be kept
confidential.

=== Quarkus configuration

Quarkus needs to know where they public key is, and if it should check for an issuer
in the token.

In application.properties, enable the Auth Mechanism:

[source]
----
quarkus.smallrye-jwt.auth-mechanism=MP-JWT
quarkus.smallrye-jwt.enabled=true
----

Also in application.properties, tell Quarkus the location of the public key and which issuer
to check for:

[source]
----
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=META-INF/resources/public.pem
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=https://this-is-totally-our.domain
----

=== Securing an Endpoint

[source,java]
----
@GET
@PRODUCES(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
@RolesAllowed({"defaultUsers"})
public String hello () { return "hello"; }
----

Now only users that carry a JWT claiming the role "defaultUsers" get to access this endpoint.
The request has to be sent with the Authorization header set

== Practical Concerns - Authentication Service

*NEVER STORE A USERS PASSWORD IN PLAINTEXT*

Use hashing and salts to store the password in the database!
Cleartext passwords are vulnerable to attacks, where attackers gain READ access on the Userdatabase.
Hashing on the other hand is irreversible - once hashed, one can't get the original password back.
You can generate a hash from a password, but not vice versa.

=== Adding salts to passwords

Salts are _randomness_ that are appended to a password before hashing. This way
two users can have the same password, but different hashes are stored in the database.
The salt is then stored in cleartext in the database, so the password can still be validated.

==== Implementation

* Library used to hash passwords: link:https://shiro.apache.org/realm.html[Apache Shiro]
* Helper class: Hashed Password to store the salt and the hashed password

[source,java]
----
public class HashedPassword {

    String saltHex;
    String hexPassword;

}

public class PasswordSecurityUtils {

    private PasswordSecurityUtils() {}

    public static HashedPassword hashPassword(String password) {
        RandomNumberGenerator rng = new SecureRandomNumberGenerator();
        ByteSource salt = rng.nextBytes();
        String hashedPassword = new Sha512Hash(password, salt, 1024).toHex();
        return new HashedPassword(salt.toHex(), hashedPassword);
    }

    public static boolean validatePassword(String submittedPassword, HashedPassword storedPassword) {
        ByteSource salt = new SimpleByteSource(fromHex(storedPassword.getSaltHex()));

        String hashToTestString = new Sha512Hash(submittedPassword, salt, 1024).toHex();

        byte[] storedHash = fromHex(storedPassword.getHexPassword());
        byte[] hashToTest = fromHex(hashToTestString);

        return testIfBytesEqual(storedHash, hashToTest);
    }

    private static boolean testIfBytesEqual(byte[] storedHash, byte[] hashToTest) {
        int diff = storedHash.length ^ hashToTest.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < storedHash.length && i < hashToTest.length; i++) {
            diff |= storedHash[i] ^ hashToTest[i];
        }
        return diff == 0;
    }

    private static byte[] fromHex(String hex) {
        byte[] bytes = new byte[hex.length() / 2];
        for (int i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++) {
            bytes[i] = (byte)Integer.parseInt(hex.substring(2 * i, 2 * i + 2), 16);
        }
        return bytes;
    }

}
